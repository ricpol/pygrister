Bleeding edge: committed to the repo, not yet released on PyPI
--------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing at the moment.

v0.5.0, 2024.11.17
------------------

- it is now possible to pass additional parameters to the Requests call 
  (fixes issue #2)
- added a new type conversion system
- fixes for Grist api changes:
  Grist made (undocumented!) changes in the return value of a few Apis. 
  We opted to maintain the old returns, but now you need to *upgrade* 
  Pygrister in order to keep things as before!
  * DELETE docs/<docid> - used to return None, now returns <docid>
    Pygrister's "delete_doc" will return None as before
  * PATCH docs/<docid> - used to return None, now returns <docid>
    Pygrister's "update_doc" will return None as before
  * PATCH docs/<docid>/move - used to return None, now returns <docid>
    Pygrister's "move_doc" will return None as before
  * DELETE workspaces/<wsid> - used to return None, now returns <wsid>
    Pygrister's "delete_workspace" will return None as before
  * PATCH workspaces/<wsid> - used to return None, now returns <wsid>
    Pygrister's "update_workspace" will return None as before
  As usual, the original Grist response is always available as "resp_content"
- Python 3.13 is also supported

v0.4.0, 2024.06.15
------------------

- Pygrister is now on PyPI, and "officially" in beta status. New apis will 
  be added, but the basic interface design should be pretty stable now
- nothing changed, just a little code cleanup and a version bump to mark 
  the PyPI launch

v0.3.0, 2024.06.02
------------------

- support for the self-hosted version of Grist
- new GristApi.update_config to update config keys incrementally, without 
  re-building the configuration from scratch
- new configuration schema for the test suite, based on a config_test.json 
  file
- tests, documentation

v0.2.0, 2024.05.25
------------------

- uniform and simplify responses returned by function API calls 
  (eg, now all list_* function will return a list of dictionaries)
- uniform and simplify the record APIs: now records are always expressed 
  as lists of dictionaries, across all record APIs
- new GristApi.ok attribute
- GristApi.see_records is now GristApi.list_records
- get rid of many None defaults in parameters
- the "new_name" parameter is now optional in GristApi.update_doc
- tests, documentation

v0.1.0, 2024.05.12
------------------

Initial alpha release.
