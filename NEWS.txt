  (fixes issue #2)

v0.4.0, 2024.06.15
------------------

- Pygrister is now on PyPI, and "officially" in beta status. New apis will 
  be added, but the basic interface design should be pretty stable now

  the PyPI launch

- support for the self-hosted version of Grist
- new GristApi.update_config to update config keys incrementally, without 
  re-building the configuration from scratch
- new configuration schema for the test suite, based on a config_test.json 
  file
- tests, documentation

v0.2.0, 2024.05.25
------------------

- uniform and simplify responses returned by function API calls 
  (eg, now all list_* function will return a list of dictionaries)
- uniform and simplify the record APIs: now records are always expressed 
  as lists of dictionaries, across all record APIs
- new GristApi.ok attribute
- GristApi.see_records is now GristApi.list_records
- get rid of many None defaults in parameters
- the "new_name" parameter is now optional in GristApi.update_doc
